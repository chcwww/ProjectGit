# ProjectGit - This is our graduate project in NTPU STAT.

We present a workflow to leverage big data, exemplified by the **Acquire Valued Shoppers Challenge** on Kaggle. Through our contributions to this project, we efficiently process customers' shopping records into individualized features. Utilizing statistical knowledge, we meticulously select features and generate plots to examine data distribution, thereby constructing the importance of these features. Finally, we apply machine learning models to the transformed data, conduct inference, and provide actionable insights to decision-makers based on our data observations.
